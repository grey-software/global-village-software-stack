# Global Village Software Stack

## Overview

OSE is currently developing a set of open source blueprints for the Global Village Construction Set (GVCS) – a set of the 50 most important machines that it takes for modern life to exist – everything from a tractor, to an oven, to a circuit maker.

Grey Software proposes the exploration of a Global Village Software Stack. This would involve the curation and development of the most important open source software for modern life to exist. 

## The Stack

Software plays a part in every facet of our lives. When brainstorming which software applications would make up a society, I looked to the list of Ontario Ministries, and thought about the software needed to carry out the function of the ministry.
