# Global Village Software Stack

## Overview

OSE is currently developing a set of open source blueprints for the Global Village Construction Set (GVCS) – a set of the 50 most important machines that it takes for modern life to exist – everything from a tractor, to an oven, to a circuit maker.

Grey Software proposes the exploration of a Global Village Software Stack. This would involve the curation and development of the most important open source software for modern life to exist. 

## The Stack

Software plays a part in every facet of our lives. When brainstorming which software applications would make up a society, I looked to the list of Ontario Ministries, and thought about the software needed to carry out the function of the ministry.

### Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs

Growing Ontario’s agri-food sector and supporting rural communities, helping to create a stronger economy for the province.

- An app that analyses samples from the geography to assess agricultural viability 
- An app that allows villages to trade based on their relative agricultural needs. 
 
### Attorney General

Administering the justice system in Ontario and protecting the public by delivering a wide range of legal services.

- An AI bot that villagers can converse with to get free legal consultation. 
- A portal where villagers can connect with accredited legal experts. 


### Colleges and Universities

Helping you get the education and training you need to build a rewarding career.

- An open portal where villagers can search for institutions or individuals to attain an education from. 

### Education

Delivering early years, child care and publicly funded education from kindergarten to Grade 12.

- An app that tracks a child's skill acquisition. 
- An app that allows a society to see the skills being acquired by the next generation. 

### Government and Consumer Services

Delivering vital programs, services, and products — ranging from health cards, drivers licences and birth certificates to consumer protection and public safety — to help create a better quality of life for Ontario’s families.

- Identity managament software


### Health

Helping people stay healthy, delivering high-quality care when they need it and protecting the health system for future generations.

- An AI bot that villagers can consult for health guidance. 
- A portal for villagers to find accredited doctors. 
- Software that collects anonymized health data from villagers and gives the society an insight into its health. 

### Long-Term Care

Working to end hallway medicine, reduce waitlists and ensure that our long-term care sector has a proper path forward to handle the growing elderly population.

- A portal where villagers can sign up to help long term care patients. 

### Natural Resources and Forestry

Protecting Ontario’s biodiversity while promoting economic opportunities in the resource sector and supporting outdoor recreation opportunities.

- Software that collects biodiversity data and performs analysis on it.

### Solicitor General

Ensuring Ontario’s communities are supported and protected by law enforcement, and that public safety and correctional systems are safe, effective, efficient and accountable.

- Software to help manage correctional facilities' security procedures. 

### Transportation

Moving people and goods safely, efficiently and sustainably across Ontario to improve quality of life and support a globally competitive economy.

- A decentralized Uber for the village. 
- An app to manage the village's public transportation system. 

### Treasury Board Secretariat

Leading the government’s efforts on accountability, openness and modernization, we help deliver good government and excellent public services in the most effective and efficient way possible.

- I imagine that in our case, there would be an app that generated a report from the government related transactions on the blockchain to encourage transparency.
